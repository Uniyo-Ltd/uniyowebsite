4.1. Compiling your Booking: Once you have selected the Service you wish to book from your chosen
Business/Provider and provided the other required information, you will be given the opportunity to
submit your Order by clicking or selecting the "Book Now", "Purchase Now" or similar button. It is
important that you check all the information that you enter and correct any errors before clicking or

errors cannot be corrected (subject to paragraph 4.2. below). You will not be able to make any
booking or purchase of any service through our platform if you have not been registered
successfully. Thus we keep our trusted business and customers safe.
4.2. Amending or cancelling your Booking: Once you have booked your slot or purchased a Package
and your payment has been authorised, you will not be entitled to change or cancel your Order, nor
will you be entitled to a refund (please refer to paragraphs 4.4 and 5.6 for details of the process
relating to rejected Orders and refunding of payment). If you wish to change or cancel your Order,
you may contact the Business if their contact details are available. Or you may contact our Customer
Care team as described in paragraph 6.3 and they will attempt to contact the Business in order to
communicate your requests. However, there is no guarantee that we will be able to reach the
Business or that the Business will agree to your requests as they may have already started
processing your Order.
4.3. Payment authorisation: Where any payment you make is not authorised, your Purchase will not
be processed or communicated to the relevant Business.
4.4. Processing your Order and Business rejections: On receipt of your Booking, we will send it to the
relevant Business and will notify you by email that your Booking has been received and is being
processed. Please note that any confirmation page that you may see on the Website and any
Booking confirmation email that you may receive each confirm that you have a contract for the
service with a Business but does not necessarily mean that your Booking will be fulfilled by the
Business. We encourage all our Businesses to accept all Bookings and to communicate any rejection
promptly, and we will notify you (generally by email) as soon as reasonably practicable if a Business
rejects your Booking. However, Businesses have the ability to reject Orders at any time because they
are too busy, due to weather conditions or for any other reason. In doing so, Businesses will be in
breach of their agreement with you and any payment made in respect of the order will be returned
to you in accordance with paragraph 5.6 below.
4.5. Fulfilment of your Booking: Estimated times for service fulfilment are provided by the
Businesses and are only estimates. Neither we nor the Businesses guarantee that Bookings will be
completed. By Booking a service, you are confirming that You will attend the business address few
minutes before the time period given by the business in order to be serviced on time and
successfully. If the Service booked will take place in any given address You the customer have
provided you are entitled to be present at the delivery address you indicated in order for the service
to be successfully completed. If you are not present at the address you have provided, we will make
reasonable efforts to contact you in order to determine your availability. If we are unable to contact
you, the provider may receive the full amount paid for their service of which they have not
completed. Thus we make sure as UNIYO our trusted business providers are operate safely and do
not waste any of their capital and time.
4.6. Commercial agency: For the avoidance of doubt, any services booked through Uniyo Ltd through
the Website or Application are processed by Uniyo Ltd in its capacity as agent of the relevant
Business.
PRICE AND PAYMENT
5.1. VAT and additional costs: Prices will be as quoted on the Website. These prices include VAT.
These will be added to the total amount due where applicable. Where the Business that you book a
service provides has to travel to your requested address to complete their service, the Business may
charge you a travelling fee and/or a service charge (which we will collect on behalf of the Business,
as the Business’s agent). The travelling fee and service charge applying to your Booking may vary
depending on a number of factors, including your location, the Business you select, and the value of
the items required to complete your request, but these costs will always be shown to you before you
complete and pay for your Booking.
5.2. Incorrect pricing: This Website contains a large number of Services and it is possible that some
of the Services and Packages may include incorrect prices. If the correct price for an Service is higher
than the price stated on the Website, we will normally contact you before the relevant service take
place. In such an event, neither we nor the relevant Business is under any obligation to ensure that
the service is provided to you at the incorrect lower price or to compensate you in respect of
incorrect pricing.
5.3. Payment methods: Payment for Orders must be made by an accepted credit or debit card
through the Website or Application.
5.4. Card payments: If you pay by credit or debit card, you may be required to show the card to the
Business at the time of the service as proof of identification and so that they can check that the card
corresponds with the receipt data for the Booking. Please note that from time to time there may be
delays with the processing of card payments and transactions; this may result in payments taking up
to sixty (60) days to be deducted from your bank account or charged to your credit or debit card.
5.5. Credit and discount vouchers: A credit or discount may apply to your Booking if you use a
promotional voucher or code recognised by the Website and endorsed by UNIYO, and you pay for
any balance by credit or debit card. Please refer to our Voucher Terms & Conditions for the full
terms and conditions applicable to the use of credit and discount vouchers. Please note that because
of standard banking procedures, your bank or card issuer will initially "ring-fence" the full amount of
the Order (before any credit or discount) in your account for between 3 to 5 working days (or longer,
depending on your bank or card issuer), and this amount will therefore be unavailable in your
account for that period. The credit or discount will be applied at the time your bank or card issuer
transfers the funds for your Order to us, at which point the credit or discounted amount will not be
transferred to us and will instead be released by your bank or card issuer back into your available
balance. You acknowledge and agree that neither we nor the relevant Business will be responsible or
liable to you in relation to this delay by your bank or card issuer in the release of funds back into
your account.
5.6. Rejected Bookings: Because of standard banking procedures, once you have submitted an Order
that you are paying for by credit or debit card and your payment has been authorised, your bank or
card issuer will "ring-fence" the full amount of your Order. If your Order is subsequently rejected by
the Business (as described in paragraph 4.4 above) or cancelled for any other reason, your bank or
card issuer will not transfer the funds for the Order to us, and will instead release the relevant
amount back into your available balance. However, this may take between 3 to 5 working days (or
longer, depending on your bank or card issuer). You acknowledge and agree that neither we nor the
relevant Business will be responsible or liable to you in relation to this delay by your bank or card
issuer in the release of funds back into your account.
CUSTOMER CARE
6.1. General: Customer care is extremely important to us. Subject to paragraphs 6.5 and 11, our
Customer Care team will therefore try to assist you where possible if you have any problems with
your Order. You can contact our Customer Care team by clicking or selecting the "Need help?",
"Help" or similar button or by calling the telephone number shown on the Website.
6.2. Questions about your Order: If your Order is taking longer than expected or you have any other
problems with your Order, you can contact our Customer Care Team as described above and one of
our Customer Care Advisers will attempt to contact the Business in order to follow up on your query.
6.3. Changing or cancelling your Booking: If you wish to change or cancel your Booking after it has
been submitted and payment has been authorised, you may contact the Business using the contact
details where available on the Website. Alternatively you may contact our Customer Care team as
described above and they will attempt to contact the Business in order to communicate your
requests. However, there is no guarantee that we will be able to reach the Business or that the
Business will agree to your requests as they may have lost another potential client.
6.4. Complaints or feedback: In the event that you are dissatisfied with the quality of any Service or
the service provided by a Business, please consider providing feedback in the form of ratings,
comments and reviews on the Website (together, "Reviews") to reflect your experience. The
Reviews are an important part of our quality control process. You are responsible for ensuring that
all Reviews you provide are accurate and based on your own, genuine experience.
6.5. Compensation: The legal contract for the supply and purchase of Services is between you and
the Business that you place your Order with. We have no control over Businesses and the quality of
the Products or service that they provide, and Uniyo has no responsibility or liability for providing
any compensation to you.
If you are dissatisfied with the quality of the service provided by a Business and wish to seek a
refund, a proportionate price reduction or any other compensation, please let us know within 24
hours of booking the service or Package. Depending on the reported issue, you may be able to send
your request for compensation via our Website, or we may ask you to contact the Business directly
to file your request and, where appropriate, you will need to follow the Business's own complaint
procedures.
6.6. Processing refund requests: Where we are processing refund requests, please be aware that we
may ask you to provide reasonable evidence (such as photographs) demonstrating a reported issue
with your Order. In addition and prior to processing any refund request, we may take other relevant
factors into account, such as the details of your Order and its delivery, your account data and
ordering history, transaction data and information received from the Business.

date, the customer account will be credited by the relevant amount. Unless otherwise provided or
specified in the Specific Voucher Terms, any credit must be used within six (6) months of the date on
which the Paycode Voucher is issued. Any credit which remains unused by the Expiry Date will no
longer be available for you to use.

any means for use by an entity other than the original recipient, or stored in a data retrieval system,

"ring-fence" the full amount of an Booking (before any Voucher credit or discount is applied) in your

amount will therefore be unavailable in your account for that period. The credit or discount will be
applied at the time your bank or card issuer transfers the funds for your order to us, at which point
the credit or discounted amount will not be transferred to us and will instead be released by your
bank or card issuer back into your available balance.
15. Vouchers may not be exchanged for cash.
16. We shall not be liable to any customer or household for any loss or claim arising out of the
refusal, rejection, cancellation or withdrawal of any Voucher or any failure or inability of a customer
or household to use a Voucher for any reason.
17. We reserve the right, at any time and in our sole discretion, to add to or amend these terms and
conditions in relation to the use of Vouchers or to vary or terminate the operation of a Voucher at
any time without notice.
